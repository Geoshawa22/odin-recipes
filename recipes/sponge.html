    <h3>DRY INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
        <li>⅞ cup white sugar - <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar - <em>(optional)</em></li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>WET INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>6 eggs - <em>whites and yolks separated</em></li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol class="steps-list">
        <li><strong>Preheat oven to 350° F.</strong> Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat egg whites with the cream of tartar (if using) on high until it becomes foamy. Next, add ⅓ of the amount of sugar and beat on high until firm peaks form. When lifting the whisk, look for the tip to drop slightly. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Whisk the egg yolk mixture.</strong> In a large bowl, add the egg yolks, the remaining ⅔ sugar, salt, water, honey, and vanilla. Beat on high until fluffy, pale yellow ribbons form when lifting the whisk. The ribbon should remain for 3 to 4 seconds. Add half the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and fold gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the batter</strong> Sift the flour and baking powder into the egg yolk mixture in three parts, gently folding after each time. Next add the vegetable oil. Tip: To help incorporate the oil better, mix a few spoonfuls of the batter with the oil before adding.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold in the remaining egg whites</strong> Add the remaining ½ of the egg whites to the batter and fold gently until well combined, taking care not to deflate the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the cakes.</strong> Line two 6 inch cake pans with parchment paper along the sides and bottom. Pour the batter and bang the pan twice to remove large air bubbles. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the crust is golden brown with a raised center, about 27 to 30 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>Allow the cake to cool.</strong> Remove all the parchment paper and allow to cool completely on a cooling rack before slicing. Use a cake leveler for even slices. Serve with whipped cream and fruit or make a layered cake.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
